# AR_HAND_TRACKER

## Introduction

AR_HAND_TRACKER is an augmented reality project focused on real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition. This project aims to bridge the gap between physical hand movements and digital interactions, enabling intuitive and immersive AR experiences.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust hand tracking system that can:
- Detect and track hand landmarks in real-time
- Recognize various hand gestures and poses
- Enable natural interaction with AR content
- Provide a foundation for gesture-based AR applications

## Potential Use Cases

- **Virtual Object Manipulation**: Interact with 3D objects in AR environments using natural hand movements
- **Gesture-Based Controls**: Control AR applications through intuitive hand gestures
- **Educational Applications**: Create interactive learning experiences with hands-on AR demonstrations
- **Gaming**: Develop immersive AR games with gesture-based controls
- **Accessibility Tools**: Provide alternative input methods for users with disabilities
- **Medical Training**: Simulate surgical procedures and medical training scenarios
- **Industrial Design**: Enable designers to manipulate 3D models naturally in AR space

## Technologies Explored

This project leverages cutting-edge technologies in computer vision and augmented reality:

- **Computer Vision**: Advanced algorithms for hand detection, tracking, and landmark identification
- **Machine Learning**: Deep learning models for gesture recognition and pose estimation
- **AR Frameworks**: Integration with popular AR platforms (ARCore, ARKit, or similar frameworks)
- **MediaPipe**: Google's cross-platform framework for building perception pipelines
- **OpenCV**: Computer vision library for image processing and analysis
- **Python/C++**: Programming languages for implementing the tracking algorithms
